# CAPTCHA Service Project Checklist

## **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup**

### **Chunk 1.1: Set Up the API Framework**
- [ ] Create a basic API server using Express.js or Flask.
- [ ] Add middleware for API key authentication.
- [ ] Implement rate-limiting middleware (100 requests/minute per API key).
- [ ] Write unit tests for API key authentication and rate-limiting logic.

### **Chunk 1.2: Set Up Redis for Token Storage**
- [ ] Set up a Redis instance (local or cloud-based).
- [ ] Integrate Redis client into the API server.
- [ ] Implement functions to store and retrieve tokens with a 3-minute TTL.
- [ ] Write unit tests for Redis token storage and retrieval.

### **Chunk 1.3: Set Up a Load Balancer**
- [ ] Configure a load balancer (e.g., NGINX or AWS ALB).
- [ ] Deploy the API server behind the load balancer.
- [ ] Test the load balancer with multiple API server instances.

---

## **Phase 2: CAPTCHA Generation**

### **Chunk 2.1: Text-Based CAPTCHA**
- [ ] Implement a function to generate a 6-character alphanumeric code.
- [ ] Add distortion logic to the text (e.g., skewing, noise).
- [ ] Render the distorted text as an image (250x80px, PNG format).
- [ ] Write unit tests for text generation, distortion, and rendering.

### **Chunk 2.2: Image-Based CAPTCHA**
- [ ] Extend the text-based CAPTCHA to support custom fonts (e.g., Arial, ComicSans).
- [ ] Add background customization (solid color or image).
- [ ] Write unit tests for font and background customization.

### **Chunk 2.3: Audio CAPTCHA**
- [ ] Implement a function to convert text into speech.
- [ ] Add distortion to the audio (e.g., noise, speed variation).
- [ ] Save the audio as an MP3 file.
- [ ] Write unit tests for text-to-speech and audio distortion.

---

## **Phase 3: API Endpoints**

### **Chunk 3.1: Token Generation Endpoint**
- [ ] Implement the `/generate-token` endpoint.
- [ ] Validate input parameters (e.g., CAPTCHA type, customization options).
- [ ] Store the token in Redis with a 3-minute TTL.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the endpoint.

### **Chunk 3.2: CAPTCHA Presentation Endpoints**
- [ ] Implement the `/captcha/{token}.{format}` endpoint for image CAPTCHAs.
- [ ] Implement the `/audio/{token}.mp3` endpoint for audio CAPTCHAs.
- [ ] Write unit tests for both endpoints.

### **Chunk 3.3: Validation Endpoint**
- [ ] Implement the `/validate` endpoint.
- [ ] Validate the user response against the stored token.
- [ ] Handle errors (e.g., expired CAPTCHA, invalid response).
- [ ] Write unit tests for the endpoint.

---

## **Phase 4: Customization and Configuration**

### **Chunk 4.1: Configuration Endpoint**
- [ ] Implement the `/configure` endpoint.
- [ ] Allow developers to set default settings (e.g., font, background color).
- [ ] Write unit tests for the endpoint.

### **Chunk 4.2: Custom Background Upload**
- [ ] Implement the `/upload-background` endpoint.
- [ ] Validate the uploaded file (e.g., size, format).
- [ ] Store the file in a CDN and return the URL.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the endpoint.

---

## **Phase 5: Security and Monitoring**

### **Chunk 5.1: Enhance Security**
- [ ] Encrypt API keys at rest.
- [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting (50 requests/IP/hour).
- [ ] Write unit tests for the new security features.

### **Chunk 5.2: Set Up Monitoring**
- [ ] Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for metrics.
- [ ] Set up alarms for latency spikes and error rates >1%.
- [ ] Write unit tests for monitoring integration.

---

## **Phase 6: Testing and Deployment**

### **Chunk 6.1: Load Testing**
- [ ] Set up JMeter or k6 for load testing.
- [ ] Run baseline, soak, and peak tests.
- [ ] Analyze results and optimize performance.

### **Chunk 6.2: Deploy to Production**
- [ ] Set up auto-scaling (e.g., Kubernetes or AWS Auto Scaling).
- [ ] Deploy the API server and Redis cluster.
- [ ] Monitor the system for stability.

---

## **Phase 7: Documentation and Onboarding**

### **Chunk 7.1: Create Developer Documentation**
- [ ] Write an API reference (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI spec).
- [ ] Create a customization guide for fonts, colors, and backgrounds.
- [ ] Publish the documentation.

### **Chunk 7.2: Developer Onboarding**
- [ ] Create a developer dashboard for API key generation.
- [ ] Provide sample code for widget integration.
- [ ] Write a quickstart guide.

---

## **Phase 8: Future Enhancements (Optional)**

### **Chunk 8.1: AI-Resistant CAPTCHAs**
- [ ] Research and implement behavioral analysis or drag-and-drop challenges.

### **Chunk 8.2: Serverless Scaling**
- [ ] Migrate stateless endpoints to AWS Lambda.

### **Chunk 8.3: Custom Font Uploads**
- [ ] Implement an endpoint for developers to upload custom fonts.

---

## **Phase 9: Final Review and Cleanup**
- [ ] Review all code for consistency and best practices.
- [ ] Ensure all unit tests pass.
- [ ] Remove any unused or orphaned code.
- [ ] Conduct a final security audit.
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future projects.

---

# **Notes**
- Prioritize testing at every step.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes.
- Regularly review and update this checklist as the project progresses.
